Common Text Re-Encoder, File #1233 holds the spells, items, UI msgs, Bromides, Locations, and BPE Dictionary.  
This program is designed to overwrite the existing file with english text.  
BPE is used similar to the original JP, and with this no expansion is necessary.  
The program is written a bit sloppy, and requires the input files in the same directory.
