Lunar 2 EB Data Combiner  
This program is designed to recombine a number of data files, 1 to N and create the Saturn Lunar 2 CD files #1 and #2  

Usage                                                                 
========================================                              
l2combine.exe inputPath num_files outputPath                          
                                                                       
The input files should be located in "inputDirectory" and should be   
numbered 1 to n.                                                     
The two output files will be names "1" and "2", just as they are     
on the cd.
