Program to convert an English PSX Lunar2 script file to the "new" Saturn English TL format.  
Requires saturn file, equivalient PSX file, and output folder for input.  
The resulting file will look like the saturn file, except with the JP text swapped out for the english.  
English text is ASCII with an offset.  PSX Command code values were altered to be those of the Saturn.
