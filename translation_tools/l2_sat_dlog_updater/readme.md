Lunar 2 Saturn Dialog Updater  
This executable takes two input files:  an original saturn binary containing the game script, and a file formatted with replacement text (either with saturn or psx style control codes).  
It will create an updated the saturn binary containing the replacement text and control codes.  
This is useful for files that need to be altered, or if a straight PSX to saturn conversion is not possible due to a different number of text sections.  

Formatting of text replacement file is similar to the output produced by l2_decode program.
