File extractor for Saturn Lunar2.  In the psx version there is an idx file and a pak file.  
The idx file holds the offsets and length of the file in terms of sectors  
The pak file holds the data  
In the saturn version, the idx file is "1" and the pak file is "2"  
The psx version has a third file with filenames that does not appear to exists on the Saturn...  
So output files are just numbered 1 to N by this program.
