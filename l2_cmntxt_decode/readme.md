Lunar 2 Common Text Decoder to go here eventually.  
Input file is #1233  
Some text is encoded per the font table, some uses a 16-bit lookup to a table in the input file to produce 2 font characters.  
I havent completely figured out the format yet.  
Enemy names do not appear to be encoded in this file (or I havent figured out their decoding).
