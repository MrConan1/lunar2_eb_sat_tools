To change what you get out of a treasure chest, at 06054884, change what goes into r1 into the item you want.
Or go to the chest and edit 0x2D626a

0x0F = Rememberizer
0x10 = Luna Bromide 01
0x11 = Mias Bromide 2

0x2D = Angels Tear

0x40 althena tear
0x50 Bastard Sword
0x55 ?? Sword (109 attack)
0x58  Sword 124 attack
0x59 Althena's sword (135 attack)

0x60 = Flare

0x44C = 100 $

It looks like a lot of areas use logic from file 2441
At the end of the file is an ES script section.
There are two item print statements 0xB0xx is overwritten depending what the item is.

The first statement reads:
"Item_Name
 was obtained"

The second statement reads:
"Item_Name
 could not be carried."
or
"Item_Name found
 but inventory is full."

Probably just want to manually edit this section for simplicity.
Also want to remove _ from item names (search for "Ancient Dagger")

Need to update text but also keep items locations the same if possible, or move location of items

TBD

Fixed battle learned spells printing
   Same issue as below.
   Code is at 06084AA8 jsr @r9 (r9 = 0606dcbc) [r4 = 2847d0, r5 = 34, r6 = 0x28, r7 = 60ff9b8]
   >> 06084AA6 goes to r5 instead of r6
   >> jsr to extra code
   >> extra code does a pr save and rts at the end
>> prints 2 strings??  name and definition?
284BE0 to 060FF9B8  <-- spell name, to vram at 25c06000
2847d0 to 060ff9ec  <-- erase, to a different vram area
